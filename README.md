# ShootBossDemo
This is shootboss game
This is a unity shooting game created by myself, and the interactive control of Arduino board is realized.
In terms of game content, I designed that the attributes of shooting bullets are used to deal with different modes of bosses, 
and the boss design also includes different forms, bigger and smaller, angry state and normal state.

Game background: We always meet angry people in our life. Sometimes your behavior will make this person more angry, but it can comfort them. It all depends on your behavior.
